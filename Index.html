    <h3>My Background</h3>
          <p>This website is the start of my journey into the world of coding. I've always had a goal of being my own boss and controlling my own destiny. I love God, my kids, and hoops!</p>
      <h1>My Background</h1>
      <p>I acheived my A+ Certification while working for Verizon Wireless in 2012. As a kid I would always peek at my dad fixing things around the house, and I would try and "fix" old radios.</p>
      <h1>Why Learn Programming</h1>
      <p>I see coding as the path to entrepreneurial and financial independence, and I can still help others, something I love to do! I saw Coder Camps 4 months back, didn't pursue it, but now I'm fully invested and ready to go after my goals and dreams!</p>
